# BUZ-IN
People go to diverse locations on a daily basis, but the bulk of them are either college students or working people who commute at set times, routes, and frequently ride the same bus every day. However, there are days when either the bus or we are late, and people wait for longer time frames without recognising whether or not the bus has arrived, wasting their time and causing them to miss their commitments and lose money. 
The goal of the bus intimation system is to  inform the passengers about the schedule of the bus without any inconvenience for them and improving the sustainability to promote the use of public transportation.
